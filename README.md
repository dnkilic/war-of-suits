# Game rules
The rules are pretty simple:
• There are two players. Each player has a pile of cards to play, and a discard pile.
• The game uses a set of Poker cards.
• The set must be shuffled at the beginning of each game.
• The whole set must be split into two piles of equal size, each one must be given to each
player.
• Players have access to (and can only play) the top card of their regular pile.
• In each round, both players lay down a card. The one holding the highest value card wins
the round, and puts both cards into their discard pile.
• In case that both cards have equal value, the winner card is decided based on their suits
(clubs, diamonds. hearts or spades).
• The suit priority must be defined at random, at the start of each game.
• Aces are high (values are, from lowest to highest: 2..10, J, Q, K, A).
• The game finishes when both players have played all of their cards.
• The user with more cards in their discard pile wins the game.

# What a user can do
As a user, I want to…
• … start (or reset) a new game
• … lay down the next card to be played
• … know which player wins in each round
• … know the number of cards won by each player
• … know which user wins at the end of the game
• … be able to start a new game

# Extra
If you feel that the test wasn’t enough for you, and you want to add something more, try to add
some way to display a game summary (with a round history -who won each round-) at the end of
the game.

# Considerations
• Think of and be consistent with the architecture.
• Rely on tests to be sure about your code.
• Consider different screen sizes.
• Take performance into account.
• Feel free to use any third party libraries.
• Attach as many notes as you feel like, explaining your solution highlights and why
certain things are included and others are left out.

# Instructions
• Please, don’t publish this test on the Internet.
• You have up to 7 days to complete the test.
• Use git as the version control system.
• Add to your repository folder a compiled and working version of the app (apk file).
